# transform-phonemes

This is intended as a simple tool for the conversion between different phonemic representations of English e.g. IPA to Shavian, Shavian to Deseret etc.

## Goals

- The tool will transform short texts, using a simple map to transform from one phonemic system to another.
- The tool should be designed with flexibility in mind, allowing easy conversion between various phonemic representations.
- The tool should be easily modifiable to work with new phonemic systems.
